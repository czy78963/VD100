# Install QT and OPENCV libraries and set up the compilation environment in QTCreator
## Install QT and OPENCV libraries
- After the Petalinux project is compiled, execute the command: `petalinux-build --sdk` to obtain sdk.sh. Compiling sdk.h is time-consuming. You can download our compiled [sdk.sh](http://www.alinx.vip:81/extra_support%2F2023_2_sdk_sh%2Fsdk.sh). Copy sdk.sh to the Ubuntu system where QTCreator is located, open the terminal in the path where sdk.sh is located, and execute the command:
`chmod +x ./sdk.sh && ./sdk.sh`

- Decompress [opencv4_include.tar.gz](../../libs/opencv4_include.tar.gz), and recursively replace the decompressed *opencv4* folder with the folder of the same name in the path below:\
